### The hype of Among Us.

Recently I have been asked by people in my circles to play Among Us together. Among Us is a game made and published by InnerSloth. Lately it has been gaining traction online.

*What made this two years old game suddenly became so popular?*

-----

Firstly they have **the momentum**. Because of COVID, people are reluctant to go out and stay inside more often. They watch videos, read books, and play games more.

Secondly, because of how **convenient** the game is.
Among Us is relatively easy to pick up, even for beginners. The game has 2 sides, crewmates side and impostors side. As a crewmate, your responsibility is to call out the impostors and to finish your quests while as an impostor, you have to kill crewmates and sabotage the missions. 

You can play it from your mobile phone and computer, perk of having the cross platform system. One session of the game full of players (10/10) can hardly last for more than 10-15 minutes. 

I remember when Pokemon Go became an instant hit in 2016. That's when my circles of friends, families, colleagues, and internet forumers were all talking about the same one particular thing. Now it is happening again with Among Us.

Will Among Us keep their momentum, or will it just be a one hit wonder? Only time will tell.
